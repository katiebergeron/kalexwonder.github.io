Hello world!
It's been a long road for me to get here
but I am glad I have finally arrived. My
name is Kalex and I am grateful you have
stopped by. Some of the topics that will be featured
are music, cryptocurrency, photography, coding, sustainability
and golf. There is much more to life than what I have listed and it
may find it's way in here, but for now this is what I sticking too.

So with that, I start today talking about the Brave browser. I discovered
this browser in 2019 while playing one of my daily crypto collections
on FreeBitcoin on my mobile. I was skeptical at first as to why a browser was advertising on a crypto site, as you can find many all kinds ads for lots of sketchy things. But I decided to give it a try and boy was I surprised. This browser is amazing and if you haven't tried it out here is a link to get you started: https://brave.com/kat671

Why do I choose to use Brave everyday over other browsers? The answer is simple.
The privacy in this browser is tight and allows a user to choose
a variety of search engines. Brave also allows you to control what the browser shares and remembers, which just adds to the security and privacy it offers.My search engine choice is duckduckgo, but if you prefer Chrome or Tor that's available and are not your only options. Another reason I choose Brave is the opt-in feature for ads. For me this not only gives a cleaner home screen but really takes some of the distractions away. I like this as it saves me time and energy which goes with my lifestyle for sustainability and demand for efficiency.

One way that Brave really won me over was with the combination of cryptocurrency and the opting in for what is known at the Basic Attention Tokens (B.A.T.).
Basic Attention Tokens give the users the ability to tip sites or content creators they enjoy. However, if you don't feel like tipping it away you also have the option to sign up for a verified wallet and use the B.A.T. for yourself. Yes, you read correct. You can earn B.A.T. for just doing what you do everyday on the internet. This new method of controlling marketing and ad exposure on the internet to hit it's target base is going to revolutionize the efficiency of marketing. Not to mention add some less clutter to the internet and all versions of mailboxes. 

Finally, I enjoy Brave because they are pushing for a faster
and better online experience. With many people working from home
and children learning online, getting things done with ease and speed
can make everyone have a better day.These are just a few of the reasons
I have switched to the Brave browser and I encourage you to give it a try.

Have a wonderful day.
